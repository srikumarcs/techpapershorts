Over the course of my career, I have read hundreds (if not thousands) of technical papers. Quite frankly, I think they offer an amazing avenue to learning something new. For engineers like myself, tech papers get the right balance of introducing a problem and a high level view of the solutions to those problems using tech wizardry. This then gives people like me, a decent oppurtunity to delve deeper into the tech aspect of it, should I find it interesting or steer away from it, should I find it irrelevant or very daunting! 

But, I have always wanted to capture what I gleaned from all the papers I read in some place. For various pointless reasons, I never did. This repo is my attempt to fix that past mistake from my end.
